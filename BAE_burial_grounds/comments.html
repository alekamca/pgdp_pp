<p>The Bureau of Ethnology&mdash;later the Bureau of American Ethnology&mdash;published a total of 48 Annual Reports over the period 1879 to 1933. <font size = "-1">(1919-24 was a long year, and most reports were published a year or more after their stated date.)</font> Each Report was divided into three pieces: introductory material including summaries of what everyone in the Bureau had been doing; a&nbsp;number of free-standing articles; and an Index covering the whole volume. In later years, the individual articles got longer and fewer. Some reports have only a single book-length article.</p>

<p>At DP, each article is a separate project, and the introduction and index are combined into another project. Articles are posted separately to PG, and when a volume is finished, a whole-volume version is also posted.</p>

<tr>
<td valign = "top"><b>Potential Problems</b></td>
<td>
<p>As with all 2-round projects, be especially alert for proofing errors in the immediate vicinity of inline formatting markup. One approach is to <i>first</i> check these areas, and then clear all formatting (using the <tt>[X]</tt> button) and re-proof the whole page. Please do not feel bad about deleting formatting; much of it is so old that the Formatters will probably find it easier to throw it out and start from scratch.</p>

<td valign = "top">
<p>For information on proofing unusual characters, see the <a href = "http://www.pgdp.net/wiki/BAE/Formatting#Proofing">BAE Proofing Wiki</a>. The overall principles are the same as the current Guidelines.</p>

<td valign = "top"><b>Apostrophes</b></td>
<td>
<p>Proof the three different types of apostrophes using this markup:</p>

<p style = "margin-left: 1em;">
<tt>' &nbsp;</tt> = normal apostrophe, printed &rsquo; (curls to left = single close quote)<br>
<tt>` &nbsp;</tt> = backwards apostrophe representing glottal stop, printed &#x201B; (curls to right, similar to single open quote)<br>
<tt>[']</tt> = simple line showing pronunciation, printed ' or &acute;</p>

<p>For example, the word<br>
<img src = "http://www.pgdp.net/w/images/7/73/Apostrophe_word.png"><br>
would be proofed as<br>
<tt>&Auml;[']-t'a`ka[']-i</tt></p>

<p>Your job is to bring the formatting of this project&mdash;dating from 2005 or earlier&mdash;into line with current guidelines. If the proofers chose not to delete inline markup, you can either work with it or delete it yourself and start from scratch.</p>

<p>Make sure all closing tags are in the right place.
